# MDAP--Project-
This was a group project assigned to us during the Mine Automation and Data Analytics Practical.                                                                        
Our problem statement is that HEMM, which includes dump trucks, excavators, and bulldozers, plays a crucial role in mining and heavy industries. However, these machines frequently experience overheating due to friction, excessive workload, or lubrication failures.                                                                                   
Currently, most companies follow a reactive maintenance approach, which means they detect failures only after the damage has already occurred. Traditional sensors, such as vibration and pressure sensors, often fail to detect latent heat buildup, making them less reliable for early failure prediction.                                                 
Our project proposes a predictive maintenance system that uses advanced thermal imaging and machine learning to detect early signs of failure before they lead to breakdowns. This is achieved by:                                                                                                                                                              
• Capturing real-time temperature variations using thermal cameras,                                                                                                                 
• Processing heat signatures using AI-based image classification, and                                                                                                             
• Integrating IoT and cloud computing to analyze and visualize the data remotely.                                                                                                   
By shifting from reactive to predictive maintenance, industries can significantly reduce downtime, minimize repair costs, and extend the operational lifespan of their machines.
